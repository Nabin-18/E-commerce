    <p>An eCommerce website is any website which sells goods or services online from a single vendor. Not to be confused with marketplace platforms like Amazon or Etsy which host products from multiple vendors, eCommerce websites are standalone and personalised to a particular store or brand.</p>
    <p>
    E-commerce involves the purchase and sale of goods and services online and is actually just one part of e-business. An e-business involves the entire process of running a company online. Put simply, it's all of the activity that takes place with an online business.
